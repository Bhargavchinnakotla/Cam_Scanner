# Cam_Scanner
We have developed a PDF scanner app for android to scan documents or any sort of image and converting them into PDF files. Being a ‘documents scanner’ app, the main feature of this app is the “Scan” feature. You take any image from the camera roll or use the camera to scan any document, business card, or text on an object. You can create folders of any name and save these documents. You can easily access the locally stored files without the internet.
